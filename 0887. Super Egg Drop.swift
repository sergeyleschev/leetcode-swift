    // 887. Super Egg Drop
    // You are given k identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.
    // You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
    // Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
    // Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: k = 1, n = 2
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: 
    // Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
    // Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
    // If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
    // Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: k = 2, n = 6
    // Output: 3

    // Example 3:
    // Input: k = 3, n = 14
    // Output: 4

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= k <= 100
    // 1 <= n <= 10^4
