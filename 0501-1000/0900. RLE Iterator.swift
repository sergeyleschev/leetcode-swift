class RLEIterator {

    // Solution by Sergey Leschev

    // 900. RLE Iterator
    // We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.
    // For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.
    // Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.
    // Implement the RLEIterator class:
    // RLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.
    // int next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.

    // Example 1:
    // Input
    // ["RLEIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
    // [[[3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]
    // Output
    // [null, 8, 8, 5, -1]
    // Explanation
    // RLEIterator rLEIterator = new RLEIterator([3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]); // This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
    // rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].
    // rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].
    // rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5. The remaining sequence is now [5].
    // rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms, returning -1. This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
    // but the second term did not exist. Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

    // Constraints:
    // 2 <= encoding.length <= 1000
    // encoding.length is even.
    // 0 <= encoding[i] <= 10^9
    // 1 <= n <= 10^9
    // At most 1000 calls will be made to next.

    private var A: [Int]
    private var exhausted, currentIdx, length: Int
    

    init(_ A: [Int]) {
        self.A = A
        self.exhausted = 0
        self.currentIdx = 0
        self.length = A.count
    }
    

    func next(_ n: Int) -> Int {
        var n = n
        
        while (currentIdx < length) {
            if (n + exhausted <= A[currentIdx]) {
                exhausted += n
                return A[currentIdx + 1]
            } else {
                n -= (A[currentIdx] - exhausted)
                exhausted = 0
                currentIdx += 2
            }
