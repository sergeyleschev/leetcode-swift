    // 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes
    // You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, time(i)] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute time(i).
    // Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.
    // The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.
    // You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.

    // Return the array answer as described above.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
    // Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
    // Explanation:
    // The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
    // The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
    // Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
    // Output: [1,1,0,0]
    // Explanation:
    // The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
    // The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
    // There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
    // Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= logs.length <= 10^4
    // 0 <= IDi <= 10^9
    // 1 <= time(i) <= 10^5
    // k is in the range [The maximum UAM for a user, 10^5].

    func findingUsersActiveMinutes(_ logs: [[Int]], _ k: Int) -> [Int] {
        var counter = [Int: Set<Int>]()
        var counter2 = [Int: Int]()
        var ans = [Int](repeating: 0, count: k)

        for log in logs { counter[log[0], default: []].insert(log[1]) }
        for (_, minutes) in counter { counter2[minutes.count, default: 0] += 1 }
        for (t, cnt) in counter2 { ans[t - 1] = cnt }
        return ans
    }
