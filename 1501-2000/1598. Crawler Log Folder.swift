    // 1598. Crawler Log Folder
    // The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.
    // The operations are described below:
    // "../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
    // "./" : Remain in the same folder.
    // "x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
    // You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.
    // The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.

    // Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
    // Output: 3

    // Example 3:
    // Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
    // Output: 0

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= logs.length <= 10^3
    // 2 <= logs[i].length <= 10
    // logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'.
    // logs[i] follows the format described in the statement.
    // Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.

    func minOperations(_ logs: [String]) -> Int {
        var cnt = 0

        for log in logs {
            if log == "../" {
                cnt = max(cnt - 1, 0)
            } else if log == "./" {
                continue
            } else {
                cnt += 1
            }
        }
        return cnt
    }
