    // 1395. Count Number of Teams
    // There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.
    // You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:
    // Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
    // A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
    // Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

    // Example 1:
    // Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
    // Output: 3
    // Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 

    // Example 2:
    // Input: rating = [2,1,3]
    // Output: 0
    // Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.

    // Example 3:
    // Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
    // Output: 4

    // Constraints:
    // n == rating.length
    // 3 <= n <= 1000
    // 1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5
    // All the integers in rating are unique.

    func numTeams(_ rating: [Int]) -> Int {
        var teamCount = 0

        for i in 1..<rating.count - 1{
            let origin = rating[i]
            var leftSmaller = 0
            var leftLarger = 0
            var rightSmaller = 0
            var rightLarger = 0

            for j in 0..<i {
                if rating[j] < origin {
                    leftSmaller += 1
                } else {
                    leftLarger += 1
                }
            }

            for j in i + 1..<rating.count {
                if rating[j] < origin {
                    rightSmaller += 1
                } else {
                    rightLarger += 1
                }
            }

            teamCount += (leftSmaller * rightLarger) + (leftLarger * rightSmaller)
        }

        return teamCount
    }
