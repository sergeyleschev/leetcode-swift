    // 837. New 21 Game
    // Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
    // Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
    // Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.
    // Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.
    // Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
    // Output: 1.00000
    // Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
    // Output: 0.60000
    // Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    // In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.

    // Example 3:
    // Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
    // Output: 0.73278

    // Constraints:
    // 0 <= k <= n <= 10^4
    // 1 <= maxPts <= 10^4
