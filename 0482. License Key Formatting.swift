    // 482. License Key Formatting
    // You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.
    // We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
    // Return the reformatted license key.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
    // Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
    // Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
    // Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
    // Output: "2-5G-3J"
    // Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    // s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
    // 1 <= k <= 10^4

    func licenseKeyFormatting(_ S: String, _ K: Int) -> String {
        let S = S.replacingOccurrences(of: "-", with: "")
        let s = S.uppercased()
        var sArray = Array(s)
        let count = sArray.count
        var index = K
        
        while index < count {
            sArray.insert("-", at: (count - index))
            index += K
        }
        
        return String(sArray)
    }
