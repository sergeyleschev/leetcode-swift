    // 495. Teemo Attacking
    // Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.
    // You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.
    // Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

    // Finds the total time that the enemy is in poisoned condition.

    // - Parameters:
    //   - timeSeries: Attacking time series.
    //   - duration: The poisoning time duration.
    // - Returns: The total time that the enemy is in poisoned condition.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
    // Output: 4
    // Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    // - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    // - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
    // Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.

    // Example 2:
    // Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
    // Output: 3
    // Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    // - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    // - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
    // Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10^4
    // 0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10^7
    // timeSeries is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(n), where n is the length of `timeSeries`.
    //   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.
